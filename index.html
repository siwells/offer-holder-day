        <h1>ENU SCEBE Offer Holders Day</h1>
        <p>A repository of code used for the lab & lecture during the ENU SCEBE offer-holder day</p>

        <h2>Lecture</h2>

        <h2>Lab</h2>
        <p>There is a set of <a href="https://github.com/siwells/offer-holder-day/blob/main/handout/handout.pdf">lab notes</a> that you should follow to build the breakout game example. The notes explain each step.</p>
        <p>This lab is meant to be a bit of fun. Usually we'd have weeks to build up a body of knowledge. This provides a starting place from which we can explore, during lectures and labs, and extend that knowledge. Instead, we're going to set a goal: <strong>Creating a playable browser game as quickly as possible</strong>.</p>
        <p>You can reach the goal by skipping straight to the final sub-section but exploring all of the intermediate sub-sections will help you to build knowledge and understanding of how the code that underpins the game actually works.</p>
        <p>As you develop your programming skills you'll start to discover that there are many ways to solve any given problem. This isn't the only way to create a breakout game but as you start to explore different languages, it can be useful to have a starting point to return to; a project that you understand.</p>
